# Authonomy Project

## Introduction

Authonomy is an innovative middleware designed to revolutionize authorization management for application developers. This solution decouples authentication from authorization, enabling the use of decentralized authorization mechanisms through DIDs, VCs, and VPs.

## Features

- **Decoupled Authentication and Authorization**: Leverage popular authentication methods while managing authorization independently.
