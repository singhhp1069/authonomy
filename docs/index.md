Authonomy is an innovative middleware designed to revolutionize authorization management in application development. By separating authentication from authorization, it empowers developers to leverage existing authentication methods while harnessing the benefits of decentralized authorization through DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers), VCs (Verifiable Credentials), and VPs (Verifiable Presentations).

## Problem Statement: Authorization Challenges for Developers

- **Limited Control in Traditional Systems**:
  - Constraints in auth systems where authentication and authorization are tightly coupled.
  - Limited flexibility for custom or fine-grained access control mechanisms.
- **Dependency on Authentication Providers**:
  - Relying on third-party authentication providers leads to reduced control over user data and access management.
  - Challenges in maintaining privacy and adapting to diverse user needs.
- **Complexity in Access Control**:
  - Implementing advanced access control like RBAC or ABAC is complex and resource-intensive.

## Our Solution: Authonomy

Authonomy introduces a paradigm shift, allowing application developers to continue using popular authentication providers (like Google, Facebook) for user authentication, while handling authorization in a decentralized manner using Web5 technologies.

### Key Features

- **Decoupling Authentication and Authorization**: Maintains the convenience of standard authentication methods while introducing decentralized authorization.
- **DID-Based Authorization**: Developers can define access control policies based on DIDs, enabling more secure and flexible authorization.
- **Verifiable Credentials for Access Control**: Utilizes VCs and VPs to manage user permissions in a privacy-preserving manner.
- **Enhanced Security and Data Sovereignty**: Decentralized authorization minimizes data breaches and enhances user privacy.

## Use Cases Tailored for Developers

- **E-commerce Platforms**: Implement tailored access for different user roles using DIDs.
- **Content Management Systems**: Control editing, publishing, and viewing permissions with VCs.
- **Healthcare Applications**: Manage patient and practitioner access to records with granular control.
- **Educational Tech Platforms**: Implement role-based access with easy integration into existing systems.

Authonomy offers a unique solution that aligns with the evolving needs of application developers, enhancing both security and flexibility in authorization management. Our vision is to redefine digital identity management, ensuring a more secure, flexible, and user-centric approach.
